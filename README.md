# WSDM---KKBox-s-Music-Recommendation-Challenge
This project' idea is from the Kaggle competition, WSDM [Problem link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-music-recommendation-challenge)

We appproached the solution by using LighGBM Algorithm, which was proposed in [2017 NIPS conference paper](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/Schedule?showEvent=9099). The corresponding open source LightGBM package is [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM).

The prediction accuracy of LightGBM model is about 78%, which is much larger than random guessing.
